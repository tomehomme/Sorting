# Sorting
Quicksort and InsertSort, CS14 lab9

In this lab, you are going to implement three different sorting algorithms to sort an array of 50,000 random integers. 
You should measure the elapsed time for each method.
Repeat the experiment on the sorted array as well and compare the elapsed time. 

Sorting algorithms:
Quicksort_Midpoint
Quicksort_MedianOfThree
InsertSort
